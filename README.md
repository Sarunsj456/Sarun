### **INTRODUCTION**

Businesses struggle to manage major IT technical problems examine the existing hardware to see if it is compatible with the new technology before implementing it in the company to prevent integration problems, security difficulties, and the threat of cyber hacking to their systems and data. It is time to reevaluate the purposes of technology and determine whether there are any alternatives to internal IT networks. Thankfully, there are other cloud computing options. With the advent of cloud computing, SMEs finally had a chance to regain control of their IT infrastructure. With cloud computing, you can handle all of your company's IT concerns while maintaining total control.

## Cloud Storage VS On-Premises Storage 
__________________________________________
A crucial decision that businesses must make is whether to keep their data on internal or external servers. You should be aware of the key differences between on-premises and cloud storage as you weigh their advantages and disadvantages.

## Advantages of On Premises Storage 
-------------------------------------
- Less expensive monthly internet fees: if your company doesn't use the internet or cloud-based services, you might not need to pay for such a fast connection. The necessity for a reliable connection with quick download speeds is further diminished for individuals who have on-premises storage.

- Function without internet:One of the main benefits of on-premises storage is that it does not require users to have an internet connection in order to access data. Your internal network will be accessible at any time, regardless of your internet connection, thanks to on-premises servers.

- Offer better Security: Unlike cloud storage, which is less susceptible to outsiders and prying eyes, on-premises access is totally controlled to authorized individuals only. Due to the fact that they do not store the data online, these are inaccessible to users outside of the network. 



## Why using on-site storage might not be the best choice?
___________________________________________________________
- Additional IT assistance needed: If you want to use on-premises storage, you'll additionally require IT personnel to administer and maintain your servers.
- Increasing maintenance costs: In addition to the initial capital expenditure needed to purchase servers and other hardware, it will also be necessary to continue purchasing hardware, software, and licenses to maintain or upgrade the system.
-  Increasing the likelihood of data loss: When storing data on-premises, you run the risk of losing it forever if the system breaks down or if a compromised system is taken hostage.

Data storage is one of the main ways the cloud interacts with your business. Cloud storage employs external servers that are controlled by a different organization, as opposed to on-premises servers with storage.

The capacity to store data on servers is a fundamental aspect of every organization. After all, your company depends on its servers for survival. They enable you to communicate with people worldwide, save your information, and link your staff. Previously, your only alternatives were on-site servers, but now you also have the option of using cloud-based servers.
